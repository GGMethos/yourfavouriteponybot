# AI Algorithm

So how shall we guess the users favourite pony?
There are multiple ways to do it, which we can all combine.

* Skimp through the users tweets and count the names of the particular ponies he or she is talking about
* Use Google Image Search on the users avatar
* Google the users name and look for more evidence
* Search the users name in Google image search and see which pony pictures relate to him the most

Google image search, by searching for the title of an image instead of the title itself, is pretty capable, but does not always work when the particular image is not popular.

## Fun stuff

We could also search for the user on other blogging sites such as Tumblr. I know Tumblr has a Python API, so that would be easy.
